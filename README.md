This tutorial / howto repository is to help you understand how to build simple applications with Electron and Node.js in a cross-platform compatible manner.

Code is heavily commented for easier understanding but it's always a good idea to keep the official Electron documentation at hand while looking and writing code with Electron. Application is super simple but demonstrates how to get everything up and running, after this you can do pretty much what ever you need from the application in guestion. The setup and the hard parts are now done.

## Running the application

    git clone https://github.com/mikaturunen/TUTORIAL-easy-electron.git easy-electron
    # Or alternative just "Download ZIP" and unzip into a directory called "easy-electron"
    cd easy-electron
